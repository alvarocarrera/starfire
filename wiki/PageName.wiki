#summary Self-learnign integration

= OVERVIEW =
A good fault diagnosis depends on a reliable BN. Even though the initials BN are made manually
by service operators, it's difficult to make them work accurately in every HAN. In order to improve
the diagnosis, the Knowledge Agent, which is the responsible for learning and updating the
diagnosis Bayesian knowledge, is introduced.


=1.1 Self-learning functionality =
        
The properties file, SelfLearning.properties, has to be configured for each HAN.

Self learning steps:

1.OSGI interface agents send diagnosis operation reports to a storage agent,
which is responsible for their storage in a database.

2.The knowledge agent starts the self learning process periodically (it can be
also started manually by a graphic interface). When launched, accesses the DB and
checks for reports. If any found, the expectation-maximization algorithm is started
with the initial BN and confidence file. It's necessary to have a confidence value
associated to each bayesian network.

3.When the new values are learnt, the knowledge agent distribute them to all
the diagnosis agents
